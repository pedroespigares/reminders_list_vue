# Reminders list with JQuery

This is a really simple reminder list which stores in the browser's local storage a 
list of reminders with their name, priority and creation date (which will appear as the difference 
between the current date and their creation in minutes). It will also store whether the reminder has been completed or 
not, with the possibility of deleting all completed reminders.
